* Building and Running

  I'm currently using just [[https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/index.html][cabal]] on this project, but stack should also work
  fine after doing ~stack init~.

  Run the Advent of Code haskell executable, which prints out solutions:

  ~cabal new-run aoc-haskell-exe~

  Run Tests:

  ~cabal new-run aoc-haskell-text~

  Run [[https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid][ghcid]] for the executable and library:

  ~ghcid -c "cabal new-repl"~

  Run [[https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid][ghcid]] for the tests:

  ~ghcid -c "cabal new-repl aoc-haskell-text" -T=:main~
